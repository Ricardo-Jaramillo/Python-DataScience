# Python for Data Science

## Requirements
### Libraries
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy
- pyodc (if you need to connect to a database)

### Dataset
For this project I used a connection to a SQL Database, so the pyodbc library is installed. But you could either import a csv file or make a connection to where your dataset is located.


## Methods included in the data_science Class
### Plots
1. Pareto's Chart
2. Histogram
3. Bars' charts
4. Scatter Plot
5. Probability Plot

### Measures of central tendency and other statistical metrics
6. Skew
7. Variance, Covariance, Standard Deviation and Variance coefficient
8. Correlation coefficient
9. Standarize Normal Distribution (zscore)
10. Confidence Intervals. Z & T for var population known or unknown, respectively
11. Confidence Interval. Dependent Samples
12. Confidence Interval. Independent Samples
    1. Var populations known (populations normally distributed, var populations known, sample sizes differ)
    2. Var populations unknown but assumed are equals
    3. Var populations unknown but assumed are different (Not implemented)
13. Test for the mean. Population Variance known
14. Test for the mean. Population Variance unknown
15. Test for the mean. Dependent Samples
16. Test for the mean. Independent Samples
17. Hypothesis test

### Statistical models with Python
1. Simple linear Regression (StatsModels)
2. Multiple linear Regression (StatsModels)
3. Dummy variables
4. Logistic Regression

### Pending
1. Probability distributions
