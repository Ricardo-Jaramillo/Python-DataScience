# Python for Data Science

## Requirements
### Libraries
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy
- pyodc (if you need to connect to a database)

### Dataset
For this project I used a connection to a SQL Database, so the pyodbc library is installed. But you could either import a csv file or make a connection to where your dataset is located.

2. Histogram
3. Bars' charts
4. Skew
5. Probability Plot
6. Variance, Standard Deviation and Variance coefficient
7. Covariance
8. Correlation coefficient
9. Normal Standard Distribution
10. Confidence Interval Z
11. Confidence Interval T
12. Confidence Interval. Independent Samples
13. Confidence Interval. Dependent Samples
14. Test for the mean. Population Variance known
15. Test for the mean. Population Variance unknown

### Statistical models with Python
1. Simple linear Regression (StatsModels)
2. Multiple linear Regression (StatsModels)
3. Dummy variables
