# Python for Data Science

## Requirements
### Libraries
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy
- pyodc (if you need to connect to a database)

### Dataset
For this project I used a connection to a SQL Database, so the pyodbc library is installed. But you could either import a csv file or make a connection to where your dataset is located.


## Methods included in the data_science Class
### Plots
1. Pareto's Chart
2. Histogram
3. Bars' charts
4. Scatter Plot
5. Probability Plot

### Measures of central tendency and other statistical metrics
6. Skew
7. Variance, Covariance, Standard Deviation and Variance coefficient
8. Correlation coefficient
9. Standarize Normal Distribution (zscore)
10. Confidence Interval Z (std population known) (Not implemented since std populations mostly unknown)
11. Confidence Interval T (std population unknown)
12. Confidence Interval. Independent Samples ########## PENDING ##########
13. Confidence Interval. Dependent Samples
14. Test for the mean. Population Variance known
15. Test for the mean. Population Variance unknown
16. Test for the mean. Dependent Samples
17. Test for the mean. Independent Samples
18. Hypothesis test

### Statistical models with Python
1. Simple linear Regression (StatsModels)
2. Multiple linear Regression (StatsModels)
3. Dummy variables
4. Logistic Regression

### Pending
1. Probability distributions
